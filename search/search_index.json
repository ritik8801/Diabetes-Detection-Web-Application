Cyclomatic Complexity Metric","text":"<p>Cyclomatic Complexity corresponds to the number of decisions a block of code contains plus 1. This number (also called McCabe number) is equal to the number of linearly independent paths through the code. This number can be used as a guide when testing conditional logic in blocks. The cc command analyzes Python source files and compute Cyclomatic Complexity. The output can be filtered by specifying the -n and -x flags. By default, the complexity score is not displayed, the option -s (show complexity) toggles this behaviour. File or directories exclusion is supported through glob patterns. Every positional argument is interpreted as a path. The program then walks through its children and analyzes Python files. Every block will be ranked from A (best complexity score) to F (worst one). </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#2-halstead-complexity-metric","title":"2. Halstead Complexity Metric","text":"<p>Halstead Complexity Metric identifies measurable properties of software, and the relations between them. The hal command analyzes Python source files and computes their Halstead complexity metrics. Files can be analyzed as wholes, or in terms of their top-level functions with the -f flag. Excluding files or directories is supported through glob patterns with the -e flag. Every positional argument is interpreted as a path. The program walks through its children and analyzes Python files.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#3-maintainability-index-metric","title":"3. Maintainability Index Metric","text":"<p>Maintainability Index is a software metric which measures how maintainable (easy to support and change) the source code is. The maintainability index is calculated as a factored formula consisting of SLOC (Source Lines Of Code), Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead volume. The mi command analyzes Python source code files and compute the Maintainability Index score. Every positional argument is treated as a starting point from which to walk looking for Python files (as in the cc command). Paths can be excluded with the -e option. The Maintainability Index is always in the range 0-100.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#4-raw-metric","title":"4.

IDE","text":"<p>I use visual studio code as main IDE as it has great support for my main languages, namely R and Python. It also allows you to use the Github Copilot AI, which is great in my opinion. It is especially useful when trying out new things like libraries, because it often comes up with useful suggestions which helps exploring things faster. It has a number of extensions for different tools like sql, docker which helps to upgrade any project. The in-built explorer of vscode is also great as it easily let's you search through all files in your opened directory. You can even replace code across multiple files at once. </p> <p>Shortcuts i like: Shift+Enter is very useful. It runs the selected lines of code in a python terminal in the IDE. Ctrl+Alt+N is very useful. It runs python file immediately in the IDE. Otherwise i'm mostly using the standard shortcuts everyone else uses.</p>"},{"location":"#10-dsl","title":"10.

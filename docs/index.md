# Project Documentation
 
This is the Documentatin for my project. I ended up putting a lot of effort into the CI/CD Part as i easily get obsessed with automation.

## 1. git

<a href="https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application">Github Repository</a>

## 2. UML 

The UML Diagrams were made in Miro.
You can find the definitions here: <a href="https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/tree/main/UML%20Diagrams">UML></a>

## 4. Metrics

I used <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=ritik8801_Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application" target="_blank">Sonarcloud</a>, which is sonarqube in the cloud, as i wanted the whole project to be cloud based.
It also gives you the ability to embed lot's of different badges:
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=ritik8801_Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=ritik8801_Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application)

## 5. Clean Code

## 6. Build Management + 8. Continuous Delivery

The build management and continuous delivery are also completely cloud based.

I used Github Actions for the build management and continuos delivery because all the services i use integrate extremely well with it. 

My Github Actions Pipeline yaml: <a href="https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/blob/main/.github/workflows/github%20actions.yml">github actions.yml</a>

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/actions/workflows/github%20actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/actions/workflows/github%20actions.yml)


### Build Management 

The Github Actions Pipeline runs the unit tests by calling pytest. 

### Continuos Delivery

All Tests are run using pytest and also docs are autogenerated using mkdocs in github actions workflow, these docs are generated into 2nd branch called gh-pages<a href="https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/tree/gh-pages"></a>.
There is a technical documentation which you can view here at <a href="https://diabetesdetection.pages.dev/">Technical Documentation</a>.

Also the main documentation code is present at [Documentation Code](https://github.com/ritik8801/Diabetes-Detection-Web-Application/blob/main/docs/index.md)

## 7. Unit-Tests
The [Unit tests](https://diabetesdetection.pages.dev/testing/tests/) are written with the help of the python library pytest.

## 9. IDE
I use visual studio code as main IDE as it has great support for my main languages, namely R and Python.
It also allows you to use the <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">Github Copilot AI</a>, which is great in my opinion. It is especially useful when trying out new things like libraries, because it often comes up with useful suggestions which helps exploring things faster. It has a number of extensions for different tools like sql, docker which helps to upgrade any project. The in-built explorer of vscode is also great as it easily let's you search through all files in your opened directory. You can even replace code across multiple files at once. 

Shortcuts i like:
Shift+Enter is very useful. It runs the selected lines of code in a python terminal in the IDE.
Ctrl+Alt+N is very useful. It runs python file immediately in the IDE.
Otherwise i'm mostly using the standard shortcuts everyone else uses.

## 10. DSL
I created a class that uses the style of the Cars example in moodle:
<a href="https://diabetesdetection.pages.dev/testing/src/modelbuilding/model">"DSL" Class</a>.

## 11. Functional Programming

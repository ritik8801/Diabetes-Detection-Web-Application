# Diabetes Detection Web Application

This repository contains a python app which predicts diabetes based on user input.This is done by training a random forest classifier model on diabetes dataset to classify, diabetic patients as 1 or non diabetic patient as 0.

This project is deployed online with the use of streamlit cloud.

Some extra code is also implemented to perform test, create dsl structure.You can view this in the Testing folder of this repository.

DESCRIPTION

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

Variables	Description

Pregnancies -> Number of times pregnant

Glucose -> Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure -> Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness -> Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin -> Two hour serum insulin

BMI -> Body Mass Index

DiabetesPedigreeFunction -> Diabetes pedigree function

Age -> Age in years

Outcome -> Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0
